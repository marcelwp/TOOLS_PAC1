          Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany. 
          The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honour of Richard Wagner. 
          Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. 
          Construction began in 1869, but was never fully completed.

          The castle was intended as a private residence for the King, until he died in 1886. 
          It was open to the public shortly after his death. Since then more than 61 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle.
          More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in the summer.

            Neuschwanstein embodies both the contemporaneous architectural fashion known as castle romanticism (German: Burgenromantik), and King Ludwig II's enthusiasm for the operas of Richard Wagner.

          In the 19th century, many castles were constructed or reconstructed, often with significant changes to make them more picturesque. 
          Palace-building projects similar to Neuschwanstein had been undertaken earlier in several of the German states and included Hohenschwangau Castle, Lichtenstein Castle, Hohenzollern Castle, and numerous buildings on the River Rhine such as Stolzenfels Castle.
          The inspiration for the construction of Neuschwanstein came from two journeys that Ludwig took in 1867 – one in May to the reconstructed Wartburg near Eisenach, another in July to the Château de Pierrefonds, which Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was transforming from a ruined castle into a historistic palace.
